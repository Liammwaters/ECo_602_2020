# Introduction

This is an overview of most of the r stats features that were covered in ECo 602/634 and how to use them.


# Functions 1: Data Structure Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Look at the source code for the final project template, you'll notice the text:

{.tabset .tabset-pills}

This creates tabbed content for all the following sections that are one-level below.

- If you include them on a primary header (one #), all of the subsequent secondary headers will in tabs.




## `c()`


The function `c()` *combines* or *concatenates* its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

- All of the elements must be of the same *type*.
  - I can't combine character and numeric types in the same call to `c()`

Here's two examples using numeric and character data types:

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13)

# Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the `print()` function.

```{r}
# Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec

# The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)
```


## `data.frame()`

A dataframe stores data in a table of variables. The most common way of getting data into a data frame is through the `read.csv()` function, but if you have data that is in another format the `data.frame()` function converts that data into a data frame. The data columns have to have the same number of attributes and the data within each has to be the same type.


To subset a data frame:

- $columnname if the name is known
- The `str()` function can be used to show the names of the columns


```{r data_frame_eg_1}
dat_1 = data.frame(
  letters = c("b", "w", "B"),
  numbers_1 = c(34, 6, 123454)
)

dat_1$letters

str(dat_1)

```


## `matrix()`

Creates a matrix from the given data. `nrow = ` gives the number of rows the data should be divided into. If the data doesn't divide evenly, values are repeated from the start. `byrow = TRUE` can be used to order the data by row instead of columns (default).

```{r matrix_eg_1}
mat_1 = matrix(1:25, nrow = 4)

mat_1
```



## `length()`

Returns the legnth of whatever object was defined. Works on basically all types of values though typically most useful for vectors.

```{r length_eg_1}
num_vec
length(num_vec)

```



## `nrow()`

Returns the number of rows present in an object. 

```{r nrow_eg_1}
nrow(dat_1)

```



## `ncol()`

Returns the number of columns present in an object.

```{r ncol_eg_1}
ncol(dat_1)

```



## `dim()`

Returns the dimensions of an object. The first number is the number of rows and the second number is the number of columns.

```{r dim_eg_1}
dim(mat_1)

```


# Functions 2: Numerical Data Exploration  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `summary()`

Summarizes the object and displays the quantiles if applicable.

```{r summary_eg_1}
summary(dat_1)

```


## `mean()`

Returns the mean of a numerical object.

```{r mean_eg_1}
mean(num_vec)
```



## `sd()`
 
Returns the standard deviation of a numerical object. 

```{r sd_eg_1}
sd(num_vec)
```





# Functions 3: Graphical Data Exploration {.tabset .tabset-pills}


## `par()`

`par()` is used to set graphical parameters. For this class `par()` was always used in conjunction with the argument `mfrow = ` and a `c()` vector to display multiple charts on a single image.
        
```{r par_eg_1, fig.asp=1.0}
#creating the data for the top histogram
n = 30
norm_30 = rnorm(n)

#creating the data for the bottom histogram
n = 300
norm_300 = rnorm(n)


par(mfrow = c(2,1)) #the first number is rows and the second number is columns

hist(norm_30, main = "Histogram of random points n = 30")
hist(norm_300, main = "Histogram of random points n = 300")
```

        



## `plot()` 

Used to create scatterplots. There are lots of arguments to customize the output, some of which are shown here.

- `main = ` is the main title. It get bolded and is displayed across the top of the image.
- `sub = ` is the subtitle. It goes on the bottom underneath the x-axis label.
- `xlab = ` and `ylab = ` are the x-axis label and y-axis label respectively.
- `xlim = ` and `ylim = ` take a `c()` with the lower and upper limits for the x-axis and y-axis.
- `cex = ` takes an integer (1 is the default) for the magnification of the plot components.
- `pch = ` sets the shape of the points on the scatterplot. Takes a numeric input.
- `col = ` defines the color of the points, can take a string value as long as it matches one that is in the system. A list of colors can be found at: https://github.com/Liammwaters/ECo_602_2020/blob/d3525acbbf5f4fc3bc82457be59d0539cabe94a0/data/Rcolor.pdf


```{r scatterplot_1, fig.asp=1.0}

#to load a package, use `require()`
require(palmerpenguins)

#formula notation uses the `~`

plot(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins,
     main = "penguin bill length as expressed by body mass",
     sub = "this is the subtitle",
     xlab = "body mass in grams",
     ylab = "bill length in mm",
     xlim = c(4200, 6500),
     ylim = c(32, 63),
     cex = 1.5,
     pch = 16,
     col = "green"
)


```



## `hist()`

Used to create histograms. Similar customization arguments as `plot()`. One new one is `breaks = ` which which can be used to set the width of each bar, or column, in the histogram. It can take the form of:
- A single number for the the number of bars (but R treats this as mearly a suggestion and will ignore you if it thinks that will be ugly for some reason)
- A `c()` giving the breakpoints between bars (which R will not ignore) 
       
```{r hist_eg_1, fig.asp=1.0}
#creating the data for the histogram
n = 30
norm_30 = rnorm(n)

#example 1, with breaks = a single numeric suggestion
hist(norm_30, main = "Histogram of random points n = 30", breaks = 17)

#example 2, with breaks = a specific vector
hist(norm_30, main = "Histogram of random points n = 30", breaks = c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3))
```




## `boxplot()`

Used to create a box-and-whisker plot of the data.
        You must include two examples: a simple boxplot (i.e. one box) and a conditional boxplot (i.e. a single plot that has multiple boxes, conditioned on a categorical variable).

```{r boxplot_eg_1, fig.asp=1.0}

#to load a package, use `require()`
require(palmerpenguins)

#simple boxplot
boxplot(penguins$bill_length_mm, main = "combined penguin bill length", ylab = "bill length in mm")

#conditional boxplot that separates the bill length by the species of penguin
boxplot(
  bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins,
  main = "penguin bill length separated by species",
  ylab = "bill length in mm"
)
```




# Functions 4: Distribution Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

These are all closely related functions, the first set is for normally distributed data, the second set is for binomially distributed data. Default values: `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`

## `dnorm()`

Gives the value of the probability density function of the normal distribution. Used for continuous data.(the value is taken from the height of the curve at the x-value)

```{r dnorm_eg_1}

#create data values
#let's say that this represents length measurements from fish in a pond
x = seq(0, 20, length.out = 1000)

#use `dnorm()` to show the probability density (y-value on the chart) and set the mean and sd values
y = dnorm(x, mean = 10, sd = 3)

#plot the results
plot(x, y, main = "Normal PDF with mean of 10 and sd = 3", type = "l")
  
```


## `pnorm()`

Gives the value of the cumulative density function of the normal distribution. (the area under the curve to the left of the x-value unless `lower.tail = FALSE` in which case it is the area to the right of x.)

```{r pnorm_eg_1}
#create data
#to find percentage of fish smaller than 12cm in a pond where the mean = 10cm and sd = 3
pnorm(12, 10, 3)
```


## `qnorm()` 

Returns the quantile for a given probability. The inverse of `pnorm()`

```{r qnorm_eg_1}
#create data
#to find the quantile of a fish with the probability of 0.75 of being smaller than 24cm in a pond where the mean = 42cm and sd = 3
qnorm(0.75, 10, 3)
```



## `dbinom()`

Returns the probability of success from a set of trials when each trial has the same probability of success. 

```{r dbinom_eg_1}

dbinom(dat_all$WIWR, 6, .75)
```




## `pbinom()`


## `qbinom()`





# Functions 5: Other Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

These are some of the other useful functions that we learned how to use in class.

## `subset()`

Displays a subset of a an object. Can be used on a vector, matrix, or data frame. Arguments take boolean phrases, but they aren't required. Does need to include the data and a logical expression that indicates either what to keep or what to exclude.

```{r subset_eg_1}
#load data
require(palmerpenguins)

#the penguins data has three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo
summary(penguins$species)

#this subsets the penguin data to include only values associated with the species "Gentoo" and writes it to a new object. The "==" means a logical exact match.
dat_gen = subset(penguins, species == "Gentoo")

#the same command now shows only Gentoo for species
summary(dat_gen$species)
```




## `library()` and `require()`

These have already come up in previous code examples. Both `library()` and `require()` load R packages that have already been installed with `install.packages()` so that they can be accessed for use. `library()` returns an error if the package isn't installed and `require()` returns a warning.

```{r require_eg_1}

require(palmerpenguins)

library(pillar)
```



## `read.csv()`

Used to load data from a .csv file into a data frame.Needs either an exact file path, the relative file path if the .csv is stored in the working directory, or can be used with the `here()` function.


```{r read.csv_eg_1}

#load the "here()" function
require(here)


#this locates the "bird.sta.csv" file that is located in my "data" folder within my R project and assigns it to a new object called "dat_bird"
dat_bird = read.csv(here("data", "bird.sta.csv"))

#head() returns only the first few rows of the object.
head(dat_bird)
```




# Part 2: Data Anaylsis

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





# use a single pound sign to create this header

```{r read_bird_data}
require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv"))
```


I can use the head() function to print the first few lines of a data.frame.
Here's an example with the birds data.
```{r head_function_demo}
head(dat_birds)
```





##Demo Plot
```{r simple_plot}
hist(dat_birds$aspect)

```



## How to customize histograms

I can title using the argument main = 

```{r custom histogram 1}
hist(dat_birds$aspect, main = "Histogram of study site aspect", breaks = 36)


```
