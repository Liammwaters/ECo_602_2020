If you've already created the file index.Rmd in your docs folder, you can paste everything below the header into that document.

If you don't yet have an index.Rmd file, save this document as index.Rmd in the docs folder of your main class folder.

Edit this template to fill in your own content.


# Introduction

This is an overview of most of the r stats features that were covered in ECo 602/634 and how to use them.


# Functions 1: Data Structure Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Look at the source code for the final project template, you'll notice the text:

{.tabset .tabset-pills}

This creates tabbed content for all the following sections that are one-level below.

- If you include them on a primary header (one #), all of the subsequent secondary headers will in tabs.




## `c()`


The function `c()` *combines* or *concatenates* its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

- All of the elements must be of the same *type*.
  - I can't combine character and numeric types in the same call to `c()`

Here's two examples using numeric and character data types:

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13)

# Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the `print()` function.

```{r}
# Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec

# The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)
```


## `data.frame()`

A dataframe stores data in a table of variables. The most common way of getting data into a data frame is through the `read.csv()` function, but if you have data that is in another format the `data.frame()` function converts that data into a data frame. The data columns have to have the same number of attributes and the data within each has to be the same type.


To subset a data frame:

- $columnname if the name is known
- The `str()` function can be used to show the names of the columns


```{r data_frame_eg_1}
dat_1 = data.frame(
  letters = c("b", "w", "B"),
  numbers_1 = c(34, 6, 123454)
)

dat_1$letters

str(dat_1)

```


## `matrix()`

Creates a matrix from the given data. `nrow = ` gives the number of rows the data should be divided into. If the data doesn't divide evenly, values are repeated from the start. `byrow = TRUE` can be used to order the data by row instead of columns (default).

```{r matrix_eg_1}
mat_1 = matrix(1:25, nrow = 4)

mat_1
```



## `length()`

Returns the legnth of whatever object was defined. Works on basically all types of values though typically most useful for vectors.

```{r length_eg_1}
num_vec
length(num_vec)

```



## `nrow()`

Returns the number of rows present in an object. 

```{r nrow_eg_1}
nrow(dat_1)

```



## `ncol()`

Returns the number of columns present in an object.

```{r ncol_eg_1}
ncol(dat_1)

```



## `dim()`

Returns the dimensions of an object. The first number is the number of rows and the second number is the number of columns.

```{r dim_eg_1}
dim(mat_1)

```


# Functions 2: Numerical Data Exploration  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `summary()`

Summarizes the object and displays the quantiles if applicable.

```{r summary_eg_1}
summary(dat_1)

```


## `mean()`

Returns the mean of a numerical object.

```{r mean_eg_1}
mean(num_vec)
```



## `sd()`
 
Returns the standard deviation of a numerical object. 

```{r sd_eg_1}
sd(num_vec)
```





# Functions 3: Graphical Data Exploration {.tabset .tabset-pills}


## `par()`

`par()` is used to set graphical parameters. For this class `par()` was always used in conjunction with the argument `mfrow = ` and a `c()` vector to display multiple charts on a single image.
        
```{r par_eg_1}
#creating the data for the first histogram
n = 30
mean = 10.4
sd = 2.4
norm_30 = rnorm(n, mean, sd)

#creating the data for the second histogram
n = 300
mean = 10.4
sd = 2.4
norm_300 = rnorm(n, mean, sd)


par(mfrow = c(2,1)) #the first number is rows and the second number is columns

hist(norm_30, main = "Histogram of random points n = 30", sub = "mean = 10.4, sd = 2.4")
hist(norm_300, main = "Histogram of random points n = 300", sub = "mean = 10.4, sd = 2.4")
```

        



## `plot()` 

Used to create scatterplots. There are lots of arguments to customize the output, some of which are shown here.

- `main = ` is the main title.
- `xlab = ` and `ylab = ` are the x-axis label and y-axis label respectively.
- `xlim = ` and `ylim = ` take a `c()` with the lower and upper limits for the x-axis and y-axis.
- `cex = ` takes an integer (1 is the default) for the magnification of the plot components.
- `pch = ` sets the shape of the points on the scatterplot. Takes a numeric input.
- `col = ` defines the color of the points, can take a string value as long as it matches one that is in the system. A list of colors can be found at: https://github.com/Liammwaters/ECo_602_2020/blob/d3525acbbf5f4fc3bc82457be59d0539cabe94a0/data/Rcolor.pdf


```{r scatterplot_1, fig.asp=1.0}

#to load a package, use `require()`
require(palmerpenguins)

#formula notation uses the `~`

plot(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins,
     main = "penguin bill length as expressed by body mass",
     xlab = "body mass in grams",
     ylab = "bill length in mm",
     xlim = c(4200, 6500),
     ylim = c(32, 63),
     cex = 1.5,
     pch = 16,
     col = "green"
)


```



## `hist`

Used to create histograms. Similar customization arguments as `plot()`. One new one is `breaks = ` which 
       
    hist() required arguments:
        breaks =
    boxplot()
        Your must include two examples: a simple boxplot (i.e. one box) and a conditional boxplot (i.e. a single plot that has multiple boxes, conditioned on a categorical variable).





# Functions 4: Distribution Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





# use a single pound sign to create this header

```{r read_bird_data}
require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv"))
```


I can use the head() function to print the first few lines of a data.frame.
Here's an example with the birds data.
```{r head_function_demo}
head(dat_birds)
```





##Demo Plot
```{r simple_plot}
hist(dat_birds$aspect)

```



## How to customize histograms

I can title using the argument main = 

```{r custom histogram 1}
hist(dat_birds$aspect, main = "Histogram of study site aspect", breaks = 36)


```



## shift ctrl c will comment/uncomment selected code





print(dat_birds)
