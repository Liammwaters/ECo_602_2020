## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





# use a single pound sign to create this header

```{r read_bird_data}
require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv"))
```


I can use the head() function to print the first few lines of a data.frame.
Here's an example with the birds data.
```{r head_function_demo}
head(dat_birds)
```





##Demo Plot
```{r simple_plot}
hist(dat_birds$aspect)

```



## How to customize histograms

I can title using the argument main = 

```{r custom histogram 1}
hist(dat_birds$aspect, main = "Histogram of study site aspect", breaks = 36)


```



## shift ctrl c will comment/uncomment selected code





print(dat_birds)
